## <a href="http://middleweather.pl">Middleweather - Check your weather!</a>

The main goal is to rebuild simple the application using React!\
I just wanna do, a site that will show you the weather and some cool art, from your favorite game/show.\
For now - I can only show you weather stats, but believe me - I'm working on the next step!
This is a project that I left, but it's time to refresh it! There is a lot of repetitive code, static stuff and bad approaches - let's fix it!

## Current state

Omg, I'm probably gonna kill myself, there is so much to do.

## My goals!

- [ ] Tailwind clean up.
- [ ] Logic remake.
- [ ] Make an app that will show weather stats for any city that the user will type.
- [ ] The background is changing with the actual weather in the city that you are currently checking.
- [ ] Users can switch between themes, like Lord of the Rings or Critical Role. Changing theme, changes backgrounds.
- [ ] For each weather stat, the app will show you short, funny and connected to theme advice for clothing.
- [ ] The app will find the user and show him the actual weather for his current localization. (I'm still considering that)

## API and Arts.

For taking the weather stats, I'm using the [OpenWeather Api](https://openweathermap.org/api).\
For now, all the arts are taken from Critical Role Wiki, and it's really important for me - to mark, that I don't want to use them without the agreement of creators. If you see that your art is being used without your agreement - please contact me.
